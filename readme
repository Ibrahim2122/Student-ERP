# Mini School Management ERP using Odoo

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Mini School Management ERP System** developed using **Odoo Community Edition** as part of an undergraduate **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP Systems)** course.

The system demonstrates core ERP concepts such as **modularity, integration, security, reporting, automation, and decision support**, applied to the education domain.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement a small but realistic ERP system  
- Customize and extend an open-source ERP (Odoo)  
- Integrate multiple functional modules  
- Provide reporting and dashboards  
- Apply role-based security  
- Support testing and demonstration using dummy data  

---

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **ERP Platform:** Odoo Community Edition  
- **Backend:** Python  
- **Frontend:** XML (views, menus, reports)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Deployment:** Localhost (development environment)  

---

## 🧩 Implemented Modules

### Student Management
- Student records with computed age  

### Course Management
- Computer Science courses  

### Enrollment
- Student–Course linkage  
- Business rule to prevent duplicate enrollments  

### Fees / Finance
- Fee tracking  
- Payment status  
- Due dates  

### Reporting & Dashboard
- Pivot tables and charts for enrollments and fees  

### Automation
- Button-based dummy data generator  

---

## 📊 Reporting & Decision Support

The system provides analytical views using Odoo’s reporting engine:

- Enrollments per course (pivot & chart)  
- Paid vs unpaid fees (pivot & chart)  

These reports help administrators analyze **course demand** and **financial status**.

---

## 🔐 Security

Role-based access control is implemented using Odoo security groups:

- **Student User:** Read-only access  
- **Student Admin:** Full access  

Permissions are enforced using `ir.model.access.csv`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Basic module-level and system-level testing was performed, including:

- Duplicate enrollment prevention  
- Fee amount validation  
- Role-based access verification  
- Report generation checks  

Dummy data is used for testing and demonstrations.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Custom module deployed in Odoo `custom_addons` directory  
- Installed and upgraded via Odoo Apps interface  
- Dummy data generated automatically using a custom wizard
